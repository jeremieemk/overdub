I had been working in FM radio\n      stations as an engineer for a few years and I wanted to take advantage of\n      streaming technology to build a truly international and multilingual radio\n      station on the internet. Groovalizacion radio was born in 2008 in the\n      midst of my ’nomadic years’ (I lived in 7 countries in 10 years). I built\n      the first version on Joomla and I have helped designing the following\n      versions since although I didn’t develop them myself. During those years I\n      was busy having a career as a DJ and producer. I always had in the back of\n      my mind that studying computer science would be a fantastic tool to renew\n      my approach to music making and to open myself to new intellectual\n      horizons.\n    </p>\n    {style}\n  </div>\n);\n\nconst style = (\n  <style jsx>{`\n  .about-text {\n    color: white;\n    font-family: var(--font2);\n    padding-left: 3rem;\n    padding-right: 3rem;\n    text-align: right;\n  }\n  .upper-text {\n    font-size: 1rem;\n  }\n  .yellow {\n    color: var(--color2);\n    font-size: 2rem;\n    font-family: var(--font3);\n  }\n    }\n  `}</style>\n);\n\nexport default AboutText;\n"],"mappings":";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAFA;AACA;AAkBA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAmBA;;;;A","sourceRoot":""}
