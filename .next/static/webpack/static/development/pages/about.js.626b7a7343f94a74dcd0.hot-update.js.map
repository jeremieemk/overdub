I had been working in FM radio\n      stations as an engineer for a few years and I wanted to take advantage of\n      streaming technology to build a truly international and multilingual radio\n      station on the internet. <span className=\"yellow\">Groovalizacion </span>\n      radio was born in 2008 in the midst of my travels (I lived in 7 countries\n      in 10 years). I built the first version on Joomla and I have helped\n      designing the following versions since although I didn’t develop them\n      myself. During those years I was also developing a career as a DJ and\n      music producer. I always had in the back of my mind that studying computer\n      science would be a fantastic tool to renew my approach to music making and\n      to open myself to new intellectual horizons.\n    </p>\n    <h1 className=\"about-title\">\n      The technologies I have used the most so far are\n      <span className=\"yellow\"> Javascript </span> and\n      <span className=\"yellow\"> React. </span>\n    </h1>\n    <p>\n      I took the ‘CS50' course at\n      <span className=\"yellow\"> Harvard University </span> online in 2017 and it\n      was a revelation. I felt more confident to take on more ambitious\n      projects. I rebuilt my artist site using my newly-learnt skills in\n      <span className=\"yellow\"> Python </span>and\n      <span className=\"yellow\"> Javascript </span>. I connected with more\n      experienced developers as mentors and got hired for a few more projects in\n      the following years. I did a <span className=\"yellow\"> React </span>\n      project last year for an internet radio that involved interactions with a\n      map. I also built an architect portfolio using\n      <span className=\"yellow\"> jQuery </span> and Vapid. During the summer 2019\n      I also helped the Reveel team building their music metadata app on{\" \"}\n      <span className=\"yellow\"> React Native</span>.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Currently I am developing a music creativity enhancing app with my younger\n      brother using Firebase and Flutter.\n    </p>\n    {style}\n  </div>\n);\n\nconst style = (\n  <style jsx>{`\n    .about-title {\n      font-size: 1.4rem;\n      text-align: center;\n      margin-top: 2rem;\n      margin-bottom: 2rem;\n    }\n    .about-text {\n      color: white;\n      font-family: var(--font4);\n      padding-left: 3rem;\n      padding-right: 3rem;\n      text-align: left;\n      font-size: 1rem;\n    }\n    .yellow {\n      color: var(--color2);\n      font-family: var(--font4);\n    }\n    @media (min-width: 801px) {\n      .about-title {\n        font-size: 2rem;\n        text-align: left;\n        margin-top: 4rem;\n        margin-bottom: 3rem;\n        line-height: 2.3rem;\n      }\n      .about-text {\n        font-size: 1.2rem;\n        line-height: 1.9rem;\n      }\n    }\n  `}</style>\n);\n\nexport default AboutText;\n"],"mappings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vCA;AACA;AA8CA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAkCA;;;;A","sourceRoot":""}
